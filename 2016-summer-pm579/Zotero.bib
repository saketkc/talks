Regulatory information is stored both in DNA sequences and in the chromatin proteins that package the genome. The covalent modification of histones plays a critical role in signaling whether a gene or genomic region should be active or inactive. Shema et al. used high-throughput single-molecule imaging to reveal the different combinations of modifications on millions of individual nucleosomes. Single-molecule DNA sequencing determined the exact location of these modified nucleosomes in the genome.
Science, this issue p. 717
Different combinations of histone modifications have been proposed to signal distinct gene regulatory functions, but this area is poorly addressed by existing technologies. We applied high-throughput single-molecule imaging to decode combinatorial modifications on millions of individual nucleosomes from pluripotent stem cells and lineage-committed cells. We identified definitively bivalent nucleosomes with concomitant repressive and activating marks, as well as other combinatorial modification states whose prevalence varies with developmental potency. We showed that genetic and chemical perturbations of chromatin enzymes preferentially affect nucleosomes harboring specific modification states. Last, we combined this proteomic platform with single-molecule DNA sequencing technology to simultaneously determine the modification states and genomic positions of individual nucleosomes. This single-molecule technology has the potential to address fundamental questions in chromatin biology and epigenetic regulation.
Determining the location and epigenetic modification state of individual nucleosomes will help unpick the “histone code.”

	abstract = {Evolutionary maintenance of gene duplications
Understanding genetic redundancy—the maintenance of multiple copies of a gene after duplication—and its relevance to genetic evolution have long been debated. Lan and Pritchard examined gene duplicates within human and other mammalian genomes. The expression of genes appears to be controlled by dosage balance and tight coregulation of tandem duplicates. They found little evidence for gene copies evincing significantly different expression patterns. However, such changes can evolve later, after gene copies become physically separated within the genome and thus are no longer jointly regulated.
Science, this issue p. 1009
Gene duplication is a fundamental process in genome evolution. However, most young duplicates are degraded by loss-of-function mutations, and the factors that allow some duplicate pairs to survive long-term remain controversial. One class of models to explain duplicate retention invokes sub- or neofunctionalization, whereas others focus on sharing of gene dosage. RNA-sequencing data from 46 human and 26 mouse tissues indicate that subfunctionalization of expression evolves slowly and is rare among duplicates that arose within the placental mammals, possibly because tandem duplicates are coregulated by shared genomic elements. Instead, consistent with the dosage-sharing hypothesis, most young duplicates are down-regulated to match expression levels of single-copy genes. Thus, dosage sharing of expression allows for the initial survival of mammalian duplicates, followed by slower functional adaptation enabling long-term preservation.
Duplicated genes are primarily maintained in mammalian genomes by reducing expression of one copy.

	abstract = {Author Summary Evolution has produced a remarkable diversity of living forms that manifests in qualitative differences as well as quantitative traits. An essential factor that underlies this variability is transcription factor binding sites, short pieces of DNA that control gene expression levels. Nevertheless, we lack a thorough theoretical understanding of the evolutionary times required for the appearance and disappearance of these sites. By combining a biophysically realistic model for how cells read out information in transcription factor binding sites with model for DNA sequence evolution, we explore these timescales and ask what factors crucially affect them. We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data.},

With the decreasing cost of sequencing, ChIP-seq has become an indispensable tool for studying gene regulation and epigenetic mechanisms. In this Review, I describe the benefits and challenges in harnessing this technique with an emphasis on issues related to experimental design and data analysis.

	abstract = {Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) binding to promoter as well as distal enhancers. TFs recognize short, but specific binding sites (TFBSs) that are located within the promoter and enhancer regions. Functionally relevant TFBSs are often highly conserved during evolution leaving a strong phylogenetic signal. While multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a potent tool to detect the phylogenetic signal, the current MSA implementations are optimized to align the maximum number of identical nucleotides. This approach might result in the omission of conserved motifs that contain interchangeable nucleotides such as the ETS motif (IUPAC code: GGAW). Here, we introduce ConBind, a novel method to enhance alignment of short motifs, even if their mutual sequence similarity is only partial. ConBind improves the identification of conserved TFBSs by improving the alignment accuracy of TFBS families within orthologous DNA sequences. Functional validation of the Gfi1b + 13 enhancer reveals that ConBind identifies additional functionally important ETS binding sites that were missed by all other tested alignment tools. In addition to the analysis of known regulatory regions, our web tool is useful for the analysis of TFBSs on so far unknown DNA regions identified through ChIP-sequencing.},

	abstract = {A small set of core transcription factors (TFs) dominates control of the gene expression program in embryonic stem cells and other well-studied cellular models. These core TFs collectively regulate their own gene expression, thus forming an interconnected auto-regulatory loop that can be considered the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry (CRC) for that cell type. There is limited knowledge of core TFs, and thus models of core regulatory circuitry, for most cell types. We recently discovered that genes encoding known core TFs forming CRCs are driven by super-enhancers, which provides an opportunity to systematically predict CRCs in poorly studied cell types through super-enhancer mapping. Here, we use super-enhancer maps to generate CRC models for 75 human cell and tissue types. These core circuitry models should prove valuable for further investigating cell-type–specific transcriptional regulation in healthy and diseased cells.},

To identify mechanisms of TF diversification, we performed detailed comparisons of yeast C2H2 ZF proteins with identical canonical recognition residues that are expected to bind the same DNA sequences. Unexpectedly, we found that ZF proteins can adapt to recognize new binding sites in a modular fashion whereby binding to common core sites remains unaffected. We identified two distinct mechanisms, conserved across multiple Ascomycota species, by which this molecular adaptation occurred. Our results suggest a route for TF evolution that alleviates negative pleiotropic effects by modularly gaining new binding sites. These findings expand our current understanding of ZF DNA binding and provide evidence for paralogous ZFs utilizing alternate modes of DNA binding to recognize unique sets of noncanonical binding sites.},

Although the use of orthologous sequences and phylogenetic footprinting approaches may help in the recognition of conserved and potentially functional sequences, correct alignment of the short transcription-factor binding sites can be problematic for established algorithms, especially when aligning more divergent species. Here, we report a novel phylogenetic footprinting approach, CONREAL, that uses biologically relevant information, that is, potential transcription-factor binding sites as represented by positional weight matrices, to establish anchors between orthologous sequences and to guide promoter sequence alignment. Comparison of the performance of CONREAL with the global alignment programs LAGAN and AVID using a reference data set, shows that CONREAL performs equally well for closely related species like rodents and human, and has a clear added value for aligning promoter elements of more divergent species like human and fish, as it identifies conserved transcription-factor binding sites that are not found by other methods.

	abstract = {The combination of genome-wide expression patterns and full genome sequences offers a great opportunity to further our understanding of the mechanisms and logic of transcriptional regulation. Many methods have been described that identify sequence motifs enriched in transcription control regions of genes that share similar gene expression patterns. Here we present an alternative approach that evaluates the transcriptional information contained by specific sequence motifs by computing for each motif the mean expression profile of all genes that contain the motif in their transcription control regions. These genome-mean expression profiles (GMEP's) are valuable for visualizing the relationship between genome sequences and gene expression data, and for characterizing the transcriptional importance of specific sequence motifs. Analysis of GMEP's calculated from a dataset of 519 whole-genome microarray experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae show a significant correlation between GMEP's of motifs that are reverse complements, a result that supports the relationship between GMEP's and transcriptional regulation. Hierarchical clustering of GMEP's identifies clusters of motifs that correspond to binding sites of well-characterized transcription factors. The GMEP's of these clustered motifs have patterns of variation across conditions that reflect the known activities of these transcription factors. Software that computed GMEP's from sequence and gene expression data is available under the terms of the Gnu Public License from http://rana.lbl.gov/.},

	abstract = {Mapping transcriptional regulatory networks is difficult because many transcription factors (TFs) are activated only under specific conditions. We describe a generic strategy for identifying genes and pathways induced by individual TFs that does not require knowledge of their normal activation cues. Microarray analysis of 55 yeast TFs that caused a growth phenotype when overexpressed showed that the majority caused increased transcript levels of genes in specific physiological categories, suggesting a mechanism for growth inhibition. Induced genes typically included established targets and genes with consensus promoter motifs, if known, indicating that these data are useful for identifying potential new target genes and binding sites. We identified the sequence 5′-TCACGCAA as a binding sequence for Hms1p, a TF that positively regulates pseudohyphal growth and previously had no known motif. The general strategy outlined here presents a straightforward approach to discovery of TF activities and mapping targets that could be adapted to any organism with transgenic technology.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is regulated pre- and post-transcriptionally via cis-regulatory DNA and RNA motifs. Identification of individual functional instances of such motifs in genome sequences is a major goal for inferring regulatory networks yet has been hampered due to the motifs’ short lengths that lead to many chance matches and poor signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we develop a general methodology for the comparative identification of functional motif instances across many related species, using a phylogenetic framework that accounts for the evolutionary relationships between species, allows for motif movements, and is robust against missing data due to artifacts in sequencing, assembly, or alignment. We also provide a robust statistical framework for evaluating motif confidence, which enables us to translate evolutionary conservation into a confidence measure for each motif instance, correcting for varying motif length, composition, and background conservation of the target regions. We predict targets of fly transcription factors and miRNAs in alignments of 12 recently sequenced Drosophila species. When compared to extensive genome-wide experimental data, predicted targets are of high quality, matching and surpassing ChIP-chip microarrays and recovering miRNA targets with high sensitivity. The resulting regulatory network suggests significant redundancy between pre- and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.},

	abstract = {Growth and development of the Caenorhabditis elegans foregut (pharynx) depends on coordinated gene expression, mediated by pharynx defective (PHA)-4/FoxA in combination with additional, largely unidentified transcription factors. Here, we used whole genome analysis to establish clusters of genes expressed in different pharyngeal cell types. We created an expectation maximization algorithm to identify cis-regulatory elements that activate expression within the pharyngeal gene clusters. One of these elements mediates the response to environmental conditions within pharyngeal muscles and is recognized by the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) DAF-12. Our data suggest that PHA-4 and DAF-12 endow the pharynx with transcriptional plasticity to respond to diverse developmental and physiological cues. Our combination of bioinformatics and in vivo analysis has provided a powerful means for genome-wide investigation of transcriptional control.
Clusters of genes activated in different cell types of the developing worm form a regulatory network that directs foregut development in response to external stimuli.

Two theoretical contributions to this classic but unsolved problem are presented here: a method to determine the width of the aligned motif automatically; and a technique for calculating the statistical significance of alignments, i.e. an assessment of whether the alignments are stronger than those that would be expected to occur by chance among random, unrelated sequences. Upon exploring variants of the standard Gibbs sampling technique to optimize the alignment, we discovered that simulated annealing approaches perform more efficiently. Finally, we conduct failure tests by applying the algorithm to increasingly difficult test cases, and analyze the manner of and reasons for eventual failure. Detection of transcription factor-binding motifs is limited by the motifs’ intrinsic subtlety rather than by inadequacy of the alignment optimization procedure.},

	abstract = {Toward the goal of identifying complete sets of transcription 
 factor (TF)-binding sites in the genomes of several gamma proteobacteria, 
 and hence describing their transcription regulatory networks, we 
 present a phylogenetic footprinting method for identifying these 
 sites. Probable transcription regulatory sites upstream of Escherichia 
 coli genes were identified by cross-species comparison using 
 an extended Gibbs sampling algorithm. Close examination of a study 
 set of 184 genes with documented transcription regulatory sites 
 revealed that when orthologous data were available from at least 
 two other gamma proteobacterial species, 81\% of our predictions corresponded 
 with the documented sites, and 67\% corresponded when data 
 from only one other species were available. That the remaining predictions 
 included bona fide TF-binding sites was proven by 
 affinity purification of a putative transcription factor (YijC) 
 bound to such a site upstream of the fabA gene. 
 Predicted regulatory sites for 2097 E.coli genes 
 are available at http://www.wadsworth.org/resnres/bioinfo/.},

It can analyze peak regions identified by ChIP-seq, cross-linking sites identified by CLIP-seq and related assays, as well as sets of genomic regions selected using other criteria. MEME-ChIP performs de novo motif discovery, motif enrichment analysis, motif location analysis and motif clustering, providing a comprehensive picture of the DNA or RNA motifs that are enriched in the input sequences. MEME-ChIP performs two complementary types of de novo motif discovery: weight matrix–based discovery for high accuracy; and word-based discovery for high sensitivity. Motif enrichment analysis using DNA or RNA motifs from human, mouse, worm, fly and other model organisms provides even greater sensitivity. MEME-ChIP's interactive HTML output groups and aligns significant motifs to ease interpretation. This protocol takes less than 3 h, and it provides motif discovery approaches that are distinct and complementary to other online methods.},

	abstract = {Accurate maps of promoters and enhancers are required for understanding transcriptional regulation. Promoters and enhancers are usually mapped by integration of chromatin assays charting histone modifications, DNA accessibility, and transcription factor binding. However, current algorithms are limited by unrealistic data distribution assumptions. Here we propose GenoSTAN (Genomic STate ANnotation), a hidden Markov model overcoming these limitations. We map promoters and enhancers for 127 cell types and tissues from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, today's largest compendium of chromatin assays. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GenoSTAN consistently identifies promoters and enhancers with significantly higher accuracy than previous methods. Moreover, GenoSTAN-derived promoters and enhancers showed significantly higher enrichment of complex trait-associated genetic variants than current annotations. Altogether, GenoSTAN provides an easy-to-use tool to define promoters and enhancers in any system, and our annotation of human transcriptional cis-regulatory elements constitutes a rich resource for future research in biology and medicine.},

	abstract = {Reef-building corals rely on an obligate symbiosis with dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium. In many corals, symbiont-free coral larvae disperse great distances and acquire their symbionts upon recruitment. Assuming that symbionts adapt locally due to limited dispersal capacity, it has been hypothesized that re-pairing with locally available symbionts could increase coral fitness across diverse environments. This ′global host-local symbiont′ hypothesis predicts that coral hosts should exhibit weak population structure and maintain high promiscuity towards their symbiosis partner, while symbionts should have strong genetic structure among locations and show host fidelity. Here, we tested this hypothesis in two species of Acropora corals from Micronesia by comparing genetic structures of the coral host and algal symbiont across different spatial scales. Each coral host species associated with two genetically distinct symbiont lineages, confirming that coral hosts are capable of high promiscuity. Within each location, the two coral hosts associated with divergent Symbiodinium genotypes of the same lineage, confirming that local symbionts exhibit host fidelity. Still, contrary to our initial expectation and unlike the coral host, symbiont genetic structure was not shaped by physical connectivity barriers and instead depended on local reef environment and host identity. Overall, these patterns support the view that association with local Symbiodinium could provide a mechanism to improve coral fitness across variable environments. However, variation in coral-Symbiodinium associations appears to be driven not by local adaptation of dispersal-limited symbionts, but by continuous evolution of broadly distributed host-specific symbiont lineages adapting to particular reef environments.},

	abstract = {Binding of transcription factors (TFs) to regulatory sequences is a pivotal step in the control of gene expression. Despite many advances in the characterization of sequence motifs recognized by TFs, our ability to quantitatively predict TF binding to different regulatory sequences is still limited. Here, we present a novel experimental assay termed BunDLE-seq that provides quantitative measurements of TF binding to thousands of fully designed sequences of 200 bp in length within a single experiment. Applying this binding assay to two yeast TFs we demonstrate that sequences outside the core TF binding site profoundly affect TF binding. We show that TF-specific models based on the sequence or DNA shape of the regions flanking the core binding site are highly predictive of the measured differential TF binding. We further characterize the dependence of TF binding, accounting for measurements of single and co-occurring binding events, on the number and location of binding sites and on the TF concentration. Finally, by coupling our in vitro TF binding measurements, and another application of our method probing nucleosome formation, to in vivo expression measurements carried out with the same template sequences now serving and promoters, we offer insights into mechanisms that may determine the different expression outcomes observed. Our assay thus paves the way to a more comprehensive understanding of TF binding to regulatory sequences, and allows the characterization of TF binding determinants within and outside of core binding sites.},

Computationally predicting these binding sites can help the biological community in understanding the nucleic acid binding proteins in the very first step. The emergence of nucleic acid binding site prediction programs and web servers during the last decade shows a great diversity in various aspects. Besides, some binding site prediction related questions, such as i) can RNA binding sites be distinguished from DNA binding sites? ii) can RNA and DNA binding sites be predicted in the same model?, have not been fully answered. Here, we benchmarked 19 web servers and 3 stand-alone programs on 41 previously reported data sets and analyzed the prediction results in different aspects to show a more complete view of how well these programs can perform and how they can be used. We hope to demonstrate some key points for unbiased comparison for further development of similar prediction programs.},

	abstract = {How the same DNA sequences can function in the three-dimensional architecture of interphase nucleus, fold in the very compact structure of metaphase chromosomes, and go precisely back to the original interphase architecture in the following cell cycle remains an unresolved question to this day. The solution to this question presented here rests on the correlations that were found to hold between the isochore organization of the genome and the architecture of chromosomes from interphase to metaphase. The key points are the following: (1) The transition from the looped domains and subdomains of interphase chromatin to the 30-nm fiber loops of early prophase chromosomes goes through their unfolding into an extended chromatin structure (probably a 10-nm "beads-on-a-string" structure); (2) the architectural proteins of interphase chromatin, such as CTCF and cohesin subunits, are retained in mitosis and are part of the discontinuous protein scaffold of mitotic chromosomes; and (3) the conservation of the link between architectural proteins and their binding sites on DNA through the cell cycle explains the reversibility of the interphase to mitosis process and the "mitotic memory" of interphase architecture.},

Here we address two problems involved in extending these results to the human genome: first, it has been unclear how many model organism genomes will be needed to delineate most regulatory regions; and second, the discovery of transcription-factor binding sites (response elements) from expression data has not yet been generalized from single-celled organisms to multicellular organisms. We found that 98\% (74/75) of experimentally defined sequence-specific binding sites of skeletal-muscle-specific transcription factors are confined to the 19\% of human sequences that are most conserved in the orthologous rodent sequences. Also we found that in using this restriction, the binding specificities of all three major muscle-specific transcription factors (MYF, SRF and MEF2) can be computationally identified.},

Unlike local search techniques such as expectation maximization and Gibbs samplers that may not reach a global optimum, the method discussed enumerates all motifs in the search space, and is guaranteed to produce the motifs with greatest z-scores. We discuss the results of validation experiments in which this algorithm was used to identify candidate binding sites in several well studied regulons of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the most prominent transcription factor binding sites are largely known. We then discuss the results on gene families in the functional and mutant phenotype catalogs of S.cerevisiae, where the algorithm suggests many promising novel transcription factor binding sites.

	abstract = {The DNA motif discovery problem abstracts the task of discovering short, conserved sites in genomic DNA. Pevzner and Sze recently described a precise combinatorial formulation of motif discovery that motivates the following algorithmic challenge: find twenty planted occurrences of a motif of length fifteen in roughly twelve kilobases of genomic sequence, where each occurrence of the motif differs from its consensus in four randomly chosen positions. Such "subtle" motifs, though statistically highly significant, expose a weakness in existing motif-finding algorithms, which typically fail to discover them. Pevzner and Sze introduced new algorithms to solve their (15,4)-motif challenge, but these methods do not scale efficiently to more difficult problems in the same family, such as the (14,4)-, (16,5)-, and (18,6)-motif problems. We introduce a novel motif-discovery algorithm, PROJECTION, designed to enhance the performance of existing motif finders using random projections of the input's substrings. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that PROJECTION remedies the weakness observed in existing algorithms, typically solving the difficult (14,4)-, (16,5)-, and (18,6)-motif problems. Our algorithm is robust to nonuniform background sequence distributions and scales to larger amounts of sequence than that specified in the original challenge. A probabilistic estimate suggests that related motif-finding problems that PROJECTION fails to solve are in all likelihood inherently intractable. We also test the performance of our algorithm on realistic biological examples, including transcription factor binding sites in eukaryotes and ribosome binding sites in prokaryotes.},

Here we use whole-genome sequences and genome- wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing data to demonstrate that natural selection has profoundly influenced human transcription factor binding sites since the divergence of humans from chimpanzees 4-6 million years ago. Our analysis uses a new probabilistic method, called INSIGHT, for measuring the influence of selection on collections of short, interspersed noncoding elements. We find that, on average, transcription factor binding sites have experienced somewhat weaker selection than protein-coding genes. However, the binding sites of several transcription factors show clear evidence of adaptation. Several measures of selection are strongly correlated with predicted binding affinity. Overall, regulatory elements seem to contribute substantially to both adaptive substitutions and deleterious polymorphisms with key implications for human evolution and disease.

We present a method (global run-on sequencing, GRO-seq) that maps the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases genome-wide. In this method, nuclear run-on RNA molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on ∼30\% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3′ cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter. These results imply that the interplay between polymerases and regulators over broad promoter regions dictates the orientation and efficiency of productive transcription.
RNA sequencing identifies antisense transcription immediately upstream of genes with transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase.

	abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies—a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly—were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional ∼12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

Since rabbit, mouse and galago all have embryonic γ genes but simian primates have fetal γ genes, we conclude that γE evolved into γF in stem-simians. An elevated non-synonymous substitution rate characterizes this transition. The alignment of ε and γ nucleotide sequences and the parsimoniously reconstructed evolutionary history of these sequences identify several anciently conserved cis-regulatory elements (phylogenetic footprints) important for γ expression in primates and also cis-mutations which may have been involved in the recruitment of the γ gene to a fetal program in simian primates.},

	issn = {1362-4962},
	abstract = {Intragenomic and intergenomic comparisons of upstream nucleotide sequences of archaeal genes were performed with the goal of predicting transcription regulatory sites (operators) and identifying likely regulons. Learning sets for the detection of regulatory sites were constructed using the available experimental data on archaeal transcription regulation or by analogy with known bacterial regulons, and further analysis was performed using iterative profile searches. The information content of the candidate signals detected by this method is insufficient for reliable predictions to be made. Therefore, this approach has to be complemented by examination of evolutionary conservation in different archaeal genomes. This combined strategy resulted in the prediction of a conserved heat shock regulon in all euryarchaea, a nitrogen fixation regulon in the methanogens Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and an aromatic amino acid regulon in M.thermoautotrophicum. Unexpectedly, the heat shock regulatory site was detected not only for genes that encode known chaperone proteins but also for archaeal histone genes. This suggests a possible function for archaeal histones in stress-related changes in DNA condensation. In addition, comparative analysis of the genomes of three Pyrococcus species resulted in the prediction of their purine metabolism and transport regulon. The results demonstrate the feasibility of prediction of at least some transcription regulatory sites by comparing poorly characterized prokaryotic genomes, particularly when several closely related genome sequences are available.},

For instance, it has been shown that mRNA data from 118 genes, measured at several time points in the developing hindbrain of mice, can be hierarchically clustered into various patterns (or 'waves') whose members tend to participate in common processes. We have previously shown that hierarchical clustering can group together genes whose cis-regulatory elements are bound by the same proteins in vivo. Hierarchical clustering has also been used to organize genes into hierarchical dendograms on the basis of their expression across multiple growth conditions. The application of Fourier analysis to synchronized yeast mRNA expression data has identified cell-cycle periodic genes, many of which have expected cis-regulatory elements. Here we apply a systematic set of statistical algorithms, based on whole-genome mRNA data, partitional clustering and motif discovery, to identify transcriptional regulatory sub-networks in yeast-without any a priori knowledge of their structure or any assumptions about their dynamics. This approach uncovered new regulons (sets of co-regulated genes) and their putative cis-regulatory elements. We used statistical characterization of known regulons and motifs to derive criteria by which we infer the biological significance of newly discovered regulons and motifs. Our approach holds promise for the rapid elucidation of genetic network architecture in sequenced organisms in which little biology is known.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Whole genome shotgun sequencing strategies generate sequence data prior to the application of assembly methodologies that result in contiguous sequence. Sequence reads can be employed to indicate regions of conservation between closely related species for which only one genome has been assembled. Consequently, by using pairwise sequence alignments methods it is possible to identify novel, non-repetitive, conserved segments in non-coding sequence that exist between the assembled human genome and mouse whole genome shotgun sequencing fragments. Conserved non-coding regions identify potentially functional DNA that could be involved in transcriptional regulation.
Results: Local sequence alignment methods were applied employing mouse fragments and the assembled human genome. In addition, transcription factor binding sites were detected by aligning their corresponding positional weight matrices to the sequence regions. These methods were applied to a set of transcripts corresponding to 502 genes associated with a variety of different human diseases taken from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. Using statistical arguments we have shown that conserved non-coding segments contain an enrichment of transcription factor binding sites when compared to the sequence background in which the conserved segments are located. This enrichment of binding sites was not observed in coding sequence. Conserved non-coding segments are not extensively repeated in the genome and therefore their identification provides a rapid means of finding genes with related conserved regions, and consequently potentially related regulatory mechanism. Conserved segments in upstream regions are found to contain binding sites that are co-localized in a manner consistent with experimentally known transcription factor pairwise co-occurrences and afford the identification of novel co-occurring Transcription Factor (TF) pairs. This study provides a methodology and more evidence to suggest that conserved non-coding regions are biologically significant since they contain a statistical enrichment of regulatory signals and pairs of signals that enable the construction of regulatory models for human genes.

	abstract = {Identifying transcriptional regulatory elements represents a significant challenge in annotating the genomes of higher vertebrates. We have developed a computational tool, rVista, for high-throughput discovery of cis-regulatory elements that combines clustering of predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and the analysis of interspecies sequence conservation to maximize the identification of functional sites. To assess the ability of rVista to discover true positive TFBSs while minimizing the prediction of false positives, we analyzed the distribution of several TFBSs across 1 Mb of the well-annotated cytokine gene cluster (Hs5q31; Mm11). Because a large number of AP-1, NFAT, and GATA-3 sites have been experimentally identified in this interval, we focused our analysis on the distribution of all binding sites specific for these transcription factors. The exploitation of the orthologous human-mouse dataset resulted in the elimination of {\textgreater} 95\% of the approximately 58,000 binding sites predicted on analysis of the human sequence alone, whereas it identified 88\% of the experimentally verified binding sites in this region.},

	abstract = {Mapping the chromosomal locations of transcription factors, nucleosomes, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling enzymes, chaperones, and polymerases is one of the key tasks of modern biology, as evidenced by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project. To this end, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard methodology. Mapping such protein-DNA interactions in vivo using ChIP-seq presents multiple challenges not only in sample preparation and sequencing but also for computational analysis. Here, we present step-by-step guidelines for the computational analysis of ChIP-seq data. We address all the major steps in the analysis of ChIP-seq data: sequencing depth selection, quality checking, mapping, data normalization, assessment of reproducibility, peak calling, differential binding analysis, controlling the false discovery rate, peak annotation, visualization, and motif analysis. At each step in our guidelines we discuss some of the software tools most frequently used. We also highlight the challenges and problems associated with each step in ChIP-seq data analysis. We present a concise workflow for the analysis of ChIP-seq data in Figure 1 that complements and expands on the recommendations of the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. Each step in the workflow is described in detail in the following sections.},

However, current methods yield ensemble profiles that are insensitive to cell-to-cell variation. Here we combine microfluidics, DNA barcoding and sequencing to collect chromatin data at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate the utility of the technology by assaying thousands of individual cells and using the data to deconvolute a mixture of ES cells, fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors into high-quality chromatin state maps for each cell type. The data from each single cell are sparse, comprising on the order of 1,000 unique reads. However, by assaying thousands of ES cells, we identify a spectrum of subpopulations defined by differences in chromatin signatures of pluripotency and differentiation priming. We corroborate these findings by comparison to orthogonal single-cell gene expression data. Our method for single-cell analysis reveals aspects of epigenetic heterogeneity not captured by transcriptional analysis alone.},

However, many paralogous TFs (i.e. members of the same TF family) perform different regulatory functions and interact with different genomic regions in the cell. A potential mechanism for achieving this differential in vivo specificity is through interactions with protein co-factors. Computational tools for studying the genomic binding profiles of paralogous TFs and identifying their putative co-factors are currently lacking. Here, we present an interactive web implementation of COUGER, a classification-based framework for identifying protein co-factors that might provide specificity to paralogous TFs. COUGER takes as input two sets of genomic regions bound by paralogous TFs, and it identifies a small set of putative co-factors that best distinguish the two sets of sequences. To achieve this task, COUGER uses a classification approach, with features that reflect the DNA-binding specificities of the putative co-factors. The identified co-factors are presented in a user-friendly output page, together with information that allows the user to understand and to explore the contributions of individual co-factor features. COUGER can be run as a stand-alone tool or through a web interface: http://couger.oit.duke.edu.},

DHSs have been mapped by capturing the ends of long DNase I-cut fragments ({\textgreater}100,000 bp), or 100–1200 bp DNase I-double cleavage fragments (also called double-hit fragments). But next generation sequencing requires a DNA library containing DNA fragments of 100–500 bp. Therefore, we used short DNA fragments released by DNase I digestion to generate DNA libraries for next generation sequencing. The short segments are 100–300 bp and can be directly cloned and used for high-throughput sequencing. We identified 83,897 DHSs in 2,343,479 tags across the human genome. Our results indicate that the DHSs identified by this DHS assay are consistent with those identified by longer fragments in previous studies. We also found: (1) the distribution of DHSs in promoter and other gene regions of similarly expressed genes differs among different chromosomes; (2) silenced genes had a more open chromatin structure than previously thought; (3) DHSs in 3′untranslated regions (3′UTRs) are negatively correlated with level of gene expression.},

	abstract = {Physical interactions between genomic regions play critical roles in the regulation of genome functions, including gene expression. However, the methods for confidently detecting physical interactions between genomic regions remain limited. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) (enChIP-Seq) to detect such interactions. In enChIP-Seq, the target genomic region is captured by an engineered DNA-binding complex, such as a CRISPR system consisting of a catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) and a single guide RNA (sgRNA). Subsequently, the genomic regions that physically interact with the target genomic region in the captured complex are sequenced by NGS. Using enChIP-Seq, we found that the 5'HS5 locus, which regulates expression of the β-globin genes, interacts with multiple genomic regions upon erythroid differentiation in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Genes near the genomic regions inducibly associated with the 5'HS5 locus were transcriptionally up-regulated in the differentiated state, suggesting the existence of a coordinated transcription mechanism directly or indirectly mediated by physical interactions between these loci. Our data suggest that enChIP-Seq is a potentially useful tool for detecting physical interactions between genomic regions in a non-biased manner, which would facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of genome functions.},

The total nuclear receptor concentration was quantified as specifically retained [3H]-hormone in manually isolated oocyte nuclei. DNA was introduced by nuclear microinjection of single stranded phagemid DNA, chromatin is then formed during second strand synthesis. The fraction of DNA sites occupied by the expressed receptor was determined by dimethylsulphate in vivo footprinting and used for calculation of the receptor-DNA binding affinity. The forkhead transcription factor FoxA1 enhanced the DNA binding by GR with an apparent Kd of ∼1 μM and dramatically stimulated DNA binding by AR with an apparent Kd of ∼0.13 μM at a composite androgen responsive DNA element containing one FoxA1 binding site and one palindromic hormone receptor binding site known to bind one receptor homodimer. FoxA1 exerted a weak constitutive- and strongly cooperative DNA binding together with AR but had a less prominent effect with GR, the difference reflecting the licensing function of FoxA1 at this androgen responsive DNA element.},
